## 👨🏻‍🔧 Install

With the project downloaded you need to install its dependencies.

```
npm install
```

After the dependencies are installed run the following code to start it.  

```
npm start
```

If everything went right your favorite browser are going to open up at the application page!

### Install with docker

if you prefer you also can run the project with docker, with the .env correctly set up run the following command to build a docker image

```
docker-composer build
```

As the image is built run up the container

```
docker-composer up -d
```

That's all that you need 🎉!
